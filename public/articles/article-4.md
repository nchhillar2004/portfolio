Using Ruby on Rails for my project was an interesting journey. Rails made it incredibly easy to set up a dynamic website with features like posts, login, signup, and authentication. With just a few commands, I was able to get these features up and running in minutes. This rapid development was one of the highlights of using Rails.

However, as a beginner, I found some aspects challenging. The learning curve was steep, particularly when it came to hosting and deploying the project. The structure of Rails applications can be quite extensive and, at times, felt bloated. For someone new to the framework, navigating through the project structure and understanding all its components was a bit overwhelming.

Despite these challenges, Rails proved to be a powerful tool for building web applications quickly. It offers great functionality out of the box but may require a deeper understanding of its structure and deployment processes to fully leverage its capabilities. Overall, my experience with Ruby on Rails was positive, though it highlighted the importance of mastering the basics to handle more advanced aspects effectively.
